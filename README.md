# CSSE120-Project
The final project for CSSE120 Python 

This was a chess robot that uses ir sensor to tell what color a chess square is to adequately move a chess piece based off of what piece it is. It uses a gui with pictures to select what piece it is. The arm will then lower and it will pick up the piece and depending on the piece can move it on how the chess piece moves. It also allows for remote input from the user with keypress events.
